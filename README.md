## Project Overview

Access to equitable healthcare remains a critical issue across the United States, particularly for rural and low-income communities.  
This project applies **data science** to integrate multiple public datasets — including synthetic versions of **Census (ACS)**, **HRSA**, and **CDC BRFSS** — to **predict and visualize underserved areas**.  

The interactive dashboard provides transparent, interpretable insights that support equitable healthcare access and ethical decision-making.
